   * Drafts mode [Uncompleted]
   * Interact with article by doing things like: Appreciate, protest, comment
   * Search
    
Application is still in early stages of development and isn't ready for production yet. if no delay occurs in our schedule, App maybe ready within 1-2 months.

## Implementation:
  * App is written entirely in kotlin except for gradle scripts which is groovy. 
  
  * Application Primarily consist of 4 layers (data, domain, presenter and view). Currently we partially finished data layer: contain most of our business logic like dataSources and Repositories
  * architecture: App is highly inspired by [iosched](https://github.com/google/iosched), it has data and domain layer in separate module and data models also in another separate module
  so architecture in both apps maybe similar However, implementation details aren't the same
  
  * App make use of many of firebase products like: 
     
     1. [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore): For storing main data, it is the primary storage in app other storage options for storing data that doesn't fit in firestore like: images
     
     2. [Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage): For storing images (and other binary data in the future)
     
     3. [Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth): Firebase-UI particularly For authenticating users 
     
     4. [Analytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics): For understanding users needs
     
  * Each object From user's perspective represented as model, For example we have a model for Article, Publisher, Category, Comment...etc
  
  * testing: data layer has extensive set of unit tests to ensure every thing is working properly, We use: 
    1. Mockito: For mocking and faking
    2. Robolectric: For tests that need android resources
    3. Truth framework: For assertions 
    
  Also the app uses [ktlint](https://ktlint.github.io/) to enforce certain styles  
    
   **NOTE**: Since i'm the only contributer to this project it is planned to Integrate [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) later
