Android app to read, write & publish articles similar to [Medium.com](https://medium.com/) or [dev.to](https://dev.to/) with using Firebase as a backend for the app,
it is mostly a challange to see how firebase can be used in real large-scale apps like Medium.com

## Some Features:
   * Follow categories to get published articles related to those categories
   * Follow specific publishers
   * write/publish articles
   * Drafts mode [Uncompleted]
   * Interact with article by: Appreciating, disagreeing or commenting
   * Search [Early development] (Implemented using [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) client)
 
## TODO: 
   * Implement the UI
   * Complete Drafts mode
   * Benchmark the hotpaths Using [AndroidX Jetpack Benchmark](https://developer.android.com/studio/profile/benchmark)
